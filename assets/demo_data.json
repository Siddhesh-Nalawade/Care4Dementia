He is frequently awake at night and wanders from room to room, turning on the lights, radio and/or television. When his daughters attempt to settle him back to bed they find that their father is very confused and can become agitated. George's family is determined to keep him at home as long as they can, however his nighttime behaviours mean that his daughters are exhausted the next day when they must meet their work and family commitments.\nIn the mornings George tends to sleep late and finds it difficult to get out of bed for his breakfast and shower when the care workers visit to assist.
